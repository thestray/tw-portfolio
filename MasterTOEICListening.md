#Master TOEIC Listening with these 5 Tips
		
Listening is easy right? You do it all the time. That means that the TOEIC Listening should be easy as well, don’t you think? 

Actually it’s not easy to pass the TOEIC listening with top marks. While listening is a receptive skill it does need effort and practice. TOEIC has a lengthy listening section that requires you to remain focused  the whole time. And it is not just listening for comprehension. You need to understand vocabulary, the difference between sounds, grammar, intonation and stress. All that while still understanding the context of the dialogue.

The TOEIC is not easy but it is used in many workplaces to test their current and potential employees. Its aim is to test how well you can communicate in English, specifically in the business and commercial areas.

Most people agree that to Master the TOEIC, you need to improve not only your basic language skills but also your test taking skills. The TOEIC often has many tricks and traps, and because you can only listen to the recording once, you need to be on the ball. 

So here are 5 tips to help you master the TOEIC listening section.

###Practice Makes Perfect. Why you Should do Practice Tests

Our First Tip. While you are preparing for the TOEIC it is important that you do constant practice under test conditions. You need to do all parts of the test paper to get used to the quick transitions, fast pace and types of tricks and traps that appear in the test. This is because you need to understand how to manage your time. Particularly for the listening section as you have no control over the speed of the questions.

But that doesn't mean you have to jump in from the first day doing full tests. If you haven’t done tests like this before it is good to build some confidence and also get a good idea of the structure of the test by doing the following: 
Start by stopping the recording after each question. 
Choose the answer that you think is correct and check if it is correct.
Make sure you know why an answer is correct or incorrect.
Gradually build up the speed by doing each section without pausing the recording. 
Then, work your way up to doing the whole test.
Starting the test like this you will also be able to see which areas you need to focus your studies on. But don't forget that it is important to start doing tests in actual test conditions as soon as possible.
		
###Mastering Part One, the True or False.

Our tip is for you to practice being able to quickly come up with as many true English sentences in your head about a given photograph as you can.

In Part One of the TOEIC listening section, you will see a series of photographs and then listen to four sentences. You have to choose the one which best and most truthfully describes the pictures. The three incorrect answers may have:
words that sounds similar but are different
the right words used the wrong way or in a confusing manner
answers that are only partially true
words related to, but not in the picture

To study for this part you can try making sentences describing what you are doing during your day. It can also help to make a list of all the things around you that you see. This helps you learn this vocabulary and link it to a place. If you don't share your house or office with anyone, you could even label everything you can see in English. Or do it anyway and scare you co-workers.

Another good way to practice is to watch videos and describe what is going on on the screen or match the description to the scene.
There can sometimes be trick questions based on pronunciation. Work on your pronunciation of vowel sounds in English. Learn words that have the same pronunciation but different meanings.
The best way to answer the questions for this part is to look at the picture completely and find out what's happening. 
Think to yourself: who, what, where, why?
Before the recording starts, look at the photo and make as many sentences in your head about what is happening in the photo as you can.

When the recording starts, decide if each of the four sentences you hear is false, maybe true or true. You might find making a cross, question mark and tick on the page with your finger helps you remember each one.  

Even if you are sure that one answer is the correct, listen to the other answers to make sure and check your answer.
If you are not sure and still have 2 or 3 options it might be, just decide with what you feel is right, write down your answer and move onto the next question. Often the choice that you feel is right the first time will be the correct answer. Thinking about it any longer won’t help and will stop you concentrating on the next question.

###Using Prediction to Answer Part Two.
Our tip for Part Two is learning how to activate what you already know and use prediction skills to imagine the correct answer before to hearing the different options. This makes it easier to answer the question correctly.

This of the TOEIC listening section is made up of 30 different questions. You will be asked a question about almost anything and you need to choose a suitable answer from 3 choices. Because the TOEIC listening is only heard once and it can be rather fast in some places.
Here you should watch out for:
words that sound similar but have different meanings
wh- questions - who what, when, where, why, what 
tag questions
yes / no questions which may have no yes / no answers
Keep in mind the question as you listen to the possible answers. Choose the answer that makes the most sense. If in doubt, guess. You don’t lose any marks for a wrong answer.

When studying for this section it’s a good idea to play the recording and listen to the question. After you’ve heard it, pause the recording and brainstorm a few answers to the question. This will help activate your knowledge and prepare you for the three different answers. After you’ve come up with a few ideas, continue to play the rest of the recording so you can identify the correct answer easier. 

###Understanding the Conversations in Part Three.

Part Three is a little longer and it is not uncommon for you to be feeling a little tired by now in the exam. But here you will need to focus and pay attention because you will want to actively listen for the answers to the questions as recording is playing.

In Part Three, you will hear a short dialogue and then have to answer 3 multiple choice questions about what you have heard. For this part the questions and answers are in your test booklet. You will need to use your short-term memory well. The things you need to watch out for in this part are:
similar-sounding words
inaccurate words
confused word order
words that change the meaning
negative words (hardly, not, etc.)
words associated with frequency (always, never, etc.)

When you are studying for this section it is best to look at the questions before you listen to the dialogue. Listen to the dialogue and then write down your answers for the question from what you have heard. Once you have done that, see if your answers matches any given for the multiple choices. This will help you focus and learn to actively listen for details in the talks.

During the actual test, try and read the questions before you listen to the recording. If you still have time, also try and read the multiple choice answers.


###How to Follow Part Four’s Short Talks.

In the fourth and final part of the listening section, you will hear three short talks about different scenarios. You will then have to answer questions about them. You will need to concentrate more carefully in this part to remember the details. Our tip for here is to find the keywords in the questions before you listen to the recording.

When you study for this part you should look at the questions and try to underline all the keywords in the questions and in the answer choices. Take some time to begin with and make sure you underline the correct words. After you get the hang of it try to do it within 7 seconds. This will be the same timing that you will have when doing the actual exam.

Part Four is the hardest section to do well in when it comes to the TOEIC listening. It’s very easy for you to fall behind because there are no breaks between the question and the recording is quite fast. This exercise will encourage you to skimming through the questions and the answers as quickly as possible. When you get faster, you will have more of a chance of keeping up with the speed of the recording which trips up many exam takers in this part.

When you are doing the actual exam pay attention to the context. Try to read the question beforehand and find the keywords if you have time. Listen to the entire talk before choosing an answer. If you find yourself running out of time just guess at an answer. Don’t miss out on information for the next question while you are trying to figure out the last one.



###Conclusion

Don’t be fooled into thinking that the TOEIC listening section is easy because it just consists of answering multiple-choice questions - it’s not. It needs a lot of practice and good time management to ensure that you will achieve a high score. Hopefully these tips will help you Master the TOEIC and let you get the score that you want.
