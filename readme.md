# Technical Writing Portfolio Samples

This repository contains several of my writing samples.

The first **MasterTOEICListening.md** is an example of a article I wrote as part of a series for an Education Startup.  
You can also find it [online here](http://www.fluentu.com/toeic/blog/toeic-listening-tips/)

The second piece **ProjectZSetup.md** is a procedure that I wrote for an internal audience in an earlier position.

The third piece **BecomeaTechnicalWriter.md** is an article that I wrote for a professional writing source website.

The final piece **CSP_6-2_Installation-Guide.pdf** is an example of a installation guide that I wrote for a product in my current position. This guide also required the creation of a new style template to match new company branding.
