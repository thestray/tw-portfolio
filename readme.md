# Techical Writing Portfolio Samples

This repository contains several of my writing samples.

The first **MasterTOEICListening.md** is an example of a article I wrote as part of a series for an Education Startup.  
You can also find it [online here](http://www.fluentu.com/toeic/blog/toeic-listening-tips/)

The second piece **ProjectZSetup.md** is a procedure that I wrote for an internal audience in an earlier position.
